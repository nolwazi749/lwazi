# How my day was

My day was good today i did freecodecamp where they introduced me on how to build a Documentation page.I did learn some thinks like nav-links and i didn't know that there are things called code element but i knownthem without knowing their names i just applied them in my work only.the challenge i had was about this section things but i have tried to come out with a solution even though am not sure whether my solution was right or wrong.
