# How my fourth day was 

My fourth day at **The Coding Ground** was great beacuse they taught me how to use github which was introduced on wednesday but I didnt know how to use it but today  did it with other student helping each other here and there.In github they taught us how to create our own website using a visual studio code and also a terminal to save it to our github and also how to save to our things in github and to do a blog for people to know more about myself.I also did typing the first thing in the morning which I think it something I should learn in the morning because am working with a computer the whole  day and after typing I did freecode camp which introduce me to new things like how to create a @media query,how to align all item horizontally and vertically.
