# Challenges i had today


Today i was busy with how to build a landing page.To be honest it was challenging some of the things  i did i didnt understand but i did them i think maybe i need to do some practise on how to build a landing page and also look for example on how to build one in other people pageand websites and also watch tutorials because this thing took me a whole day to do it but what am proud of is that i have tried to what i know without looking for a lot of help that help me because it shows me what i need to help.
