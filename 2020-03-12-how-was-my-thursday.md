# How was my thursday

My thursday was good but i had some little bit of challenges while i was busy with My Personal Website Page, some of the things i did was not appearing the way i wanted them to appear.i realised that when you want to create a website you need think of a way you want it be before making one because it needs lot if html and css so that it can be beautiful and for people to be interested in it.
